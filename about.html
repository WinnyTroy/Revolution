                  <br>University of Nairobi and Moringa school were my gateway to the evolving industry which led to the foundation of my keen interests, curisoty.

                   I wouldnt say that I was always passionate about tech ,back as a young'n, but back in the day there wasnt much tech to even be passionate about.
                   <br>But as tech grew, my interest and curiosity grew along with it<br>

          <span><h4><strong> Software Dev</strong></h4>
            Starting with building of basic static webpages several months ago, I found myself working on several more complex projects with a more
            modular approach. Simple but appealing designs and core functionality for application development grew within my work ethic. Agile guidlines
            and peer programming combined soon became and still is my daily companion.
          </span>
          <span><h4><strong> Software Engineering</strong></h4>
            My solution-oriented and strategic user-centered mindset and sensitivity with time turned out to be the perfect fit through my journey as
            a Computer Scientist in the making. Mind opening concepts still blow my mind and I appreciate the journey I have been through.
